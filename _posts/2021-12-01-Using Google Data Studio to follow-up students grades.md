# Summary

In this post I explain how you as a student (or a parent trying to follow-up your kids grades at school) can use Google Data Studio to create a cool dashboard about school/university progress.

# Google Data Studio

Data Studio is free cloud-based dashboard tool from Google which allows you to connect with different data sources, specially those on behalf of Google, like YouTube, Google Ads, Google Sheets data and many others.


# Data Source

In this example, I use a simple Google Sheets to store my son's grades (I do it together with him and it's quite fun - at least for me).
